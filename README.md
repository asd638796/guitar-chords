A guitar chord visualisation app. 

How it works:
You input a 6x4 section of the fretboard in terms of scale degrees, then input a chord in terms of scale degrees and a fret number.

The output is that chord visualised on the fretboard. 

This web app goes in tandem with a python script I generated that takes a 6x4 section of the fretboard and the scale degrees of a chord as an input, and generates all of the possible chord combinations (for that section of the fretboard) as an output. Later on down the line the goal is to turn that into a web app and have this visualisation thing built in.

Here is a Cmaj7 voicing for example:
