A guitar chord visualisation app. 

How it works:
You input a 6x4 section of the fretboard in terms of scale degrees, then input a chord in terms of scale degrees and a fret number.
The output is that chord visualised on the fretboard. 
This web app goes in tandem with a python script I generated that takes the same input but generates all of the possible chord combinations, later on down the line the goal is to turn that into a web app and have this visualisation thing built in.
